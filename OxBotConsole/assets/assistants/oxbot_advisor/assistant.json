Location information is best taken from the non-null fields in branch_1_freeformAddress through branch_46_freeFormAddress. 2.e.1. Most entries have 3 or less branches so concentrate the search on branch_1_ through branch_3 fields 2.e.2. Cities, towns, etc. are stored in branch_<number>_municipality, and states are stored in branch_<number>_countrySubdivision.   2.e.2.a. If you need county use branch_<number>_countrySecondarySubdivision 2.e.3. If still no matches are found, go out to the state level 3.e.3.a. States are stored in branch_<number>_countrySubdivision 3.e.3.b. State level matches are fine if there is no city/town level match. 3.f.
